# Kickstarter Campaign

## A breakdown of Kickstarter campaigns; goals, pledges, successes, and failures

### We took a further look at a group of Kickstarter campaigns to compare how different campaigns did in correlation to their launch dates and goal amount. 
	Is there a better time to start a campaign? Is asking for too much money a bad idea? Our analysis helps answers those questions for Louise  

### Analysis and Challenges 
	The analysis was performed by filtering through a large dataset, deciding what data will be most beneficial to Louise and her campaign,
	and presenting the data in a way that is easy to understand. The challenges that were faced come from deciding what data was important and what we could leave out. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
	In the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, we find that May is a particularly successful month.
	Followed closely by June and then July. Though May was rather successful it also had the highest number of failed campaigns. 
	It seems that May is a popular month for Kickstarter campaigns. November, December, and January prove to be the least successful months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, the highest success percentage was for campaigns that asked anywhere between 1000 and 4999 dollars.
	The highest percent of failure is from campaigns that asked for 45,000 and 49,999 dollars.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The difficulties that arose were picking a chart that would clearly show the information we wanted presented, 
	sorting through the dataset and deciding what we needed and what we didnâ€™t, and choosing the formulas that would be assist sorting the data.
